I'm a GO-SHIP Postdoctoral Tracer Fellow at the School of Oceanography working with Mark Warner, Brendan Carter, and Zach Erickson to measure trace gases (chlorofluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride) in seawater and quantify the oceanâ€™s changing carbon cycle. 

My work leverages my background in analytical chemistry and ocean observation to answer questions of carbon transport and storage, acidification, and ocean ventilation. I also have a particular interest in creating accessible tools for measuring changing ocean chemistry, which has resulted in open-source hardware and software products.

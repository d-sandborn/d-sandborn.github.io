    "text": "Past Projects\nCalcium carbonate saturation effects on Dreissenid mussel habitat funded by a graduate research fellowship from the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research\nCalcium carbonate satration state determines the solubility of calcium carbonate in aquatic environments. Organisms with shells made of calcite and aragonite (two mineral forms of calcium carbonate) are sensitive to calcium carbonate saturation state in marine environments. The potential for this environmental parameter to determine the habitat of freshwater invasive aquatic species with calcium carbonate shells has not been explored Previous work has demonstrated both calcium and pH sensitivities of Dreissenid mussels, which points towards the role of calcium carbonate saturation state as an ecological parameter of great importance. This project combines observational and experimental methods to guage the sensitivity of Dreissenid mussel development and habitat to carbonate chemical drivers.\nDeveloping a particle tracking model of the Laurentian Great Lakes supported by a grant from the National Park Service to J. Austin\nParticle tracking is a too used to model the transport of particles in a body of water described by a hydrodynamic model. This project combines the NOAA Great Lakes Observational Forecast Systems with OceanTracker, an open-source high-speed particle tracking package, to run simulated natural experiments of particle release and transport. These experiments are being applied to study aquatic invasive species, microplastics, and point-source pollution problems in the Laurentian Great Lakes.\nObservation of pCO2 in Lake Superior using underway instrumentation supported by a Grant-in-Aid from the University of Minnesota\nThe Laurentian Great Lakes act as regionally- and globally-significant carbon cycling actors, but the magnitude of their impact remains unclear due to an incomplete observational and modeling picture of their carbon biogeochemistry. This study demonstrates the use of underway instrumentation measuring pCO2 to provide accurate measurements with high temporal and spatial resolution in the largest freshwater system by area, Lake Superior. The results of this project will point the way toward expanded carbon cycling observations and improved biogeochemical model constraints.\nExpanding alkalinity measurement accessibility with open-source, low-cost instrumentation supported by a Grant-in-Aid from the University of Minnesota\nThis work demonstrated an instrument for total alkalinity measurement using open-source software and low-cost components with the goal of expanding measurement accessibility. Total alkalinity is a pivotal parameter for measurements of environmental water chemistry and ocean acidification. High-precision, high-accuracy measurements of alkalinity are crucial for obsrvations of water chemistry in a changing world. This study created the first total alkalinity system based on a Raspberry-Pi microcomputer to produce high-quality measurements with applications across the marine-lacustrine spectrum.\nPurification of meta-Cresol Purple Dye via Flash Chromatography for Accurate Seawater pH Measurement funded by the Council on Ocean Affairs Science and Technology, California State University\nThis project sought to purify a pH-sensitive dye for high-precision, high-accuracy spectrophotometric pH determination of California Central Coast seawater. Flash chromatography has been demonstrated to provide a fast and easy purification method for pH-sensitive dyes. These dyes are crucial for obtaining high-quality measurements of ocean pH as a parameter of ocean acidification."

We created an observationally-constrained global mapped product air-sea disequilibrium for chlorofluorocarbons 11 and 12 and sulfur hexafluoride using repeat hydrographic observations completed by the WOCE program and its successors. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo deconvolution method was employed to invert a surface boundary age spectrum (Green’s function) from observations representing the deep winter mixed layer in outcrops of various isoneutral slabs. Convolution of the resulting spectra with atmospheric histories of the transient tracers yielded surface boundary functions expressing tracer surface saturation throughout their histories. Application of these functions to climatologically-defined deep winter mixing outcrops yielded a spatially- and temporally- varying product illustrating the evolving surface expressions of transient gases, and enables the formulation of a single-source surface boundary function for TTD age modeling.\nClick here for a PDF of my poster.\nSupplementary information with detailed methods, results, and more.\n\n\n\nLihue, HI, USA\n“The other CO2 problem and the Laurentian Great Lakes”\nSlides available upon request.

## Outreach and Teaching

### Day of [Water] Data 2023

[A demonstration](https://d-sandborn.github.io/DayOfWaterData2023/) of data science tools applied to local water resources research.

### WikiProject Limnology and Oceanography

[A collaborative effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Limnology_and_Oceanography) to improve L&O-related content on Wikipedia. 

## Coding

### TRACE

TRACE: Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation is an algorithm for estimation of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean. It's available for MATLAB (originally -- see the [TRACEv1 paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2024-560/)) and my [Python](https://github.com/d-sandborn/pyTRACE) port. 

### RPi-Alkalinity

[Resources](https://github.com/d-sandborn/RPi-Alkalinity) for open-source, low-cost alkalinity titration with a Raspberry Pi.

## Coding

### TRACE

TRACE: Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation is an algorithm for estimation of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean. It's available for MATLAB (originally -- see the [TRACEv1 paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-17-3073-2025)) and my work-in-progress [Python](https://github.com/d-sandborn/pyTRACE) port which is the subject of a manuscript in preparation. 

### LGLParticleTracking

[Demo code](https://github.com/d-sandborn/LGLParticleTracking) for replicating and extending our Lake Superior particle tracking study. This work is the first to couple the updated Lake Superior Operational Forecast System FVCOM hydrodynamic hindhast model with particle tracking software (here, the open-source [OceanTracker](https://oceantracker.github.io/oceantracker/index.html)). This project will be described further in an NPS Report currently in review. 

### RPi-Alkalinity

[Resources](https://github.com/d-sandborn/RPi-Alkalinity) for open-source, low-cost alkalinity titration with a Raspberry Pi. This project is described further in the [associated publication](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lom3.10549).

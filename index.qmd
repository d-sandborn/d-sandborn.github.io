Daniel Sandborn is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington School of Oceanography. His work uses observations of trace gases in the ocean to quantify the ocean's response and feedback to Earth's changing carbon cycle (incl. carbon storage, ocean acidification, and ventilation). He earned his doctorate at the University of Minnesota working at the Large Lakes Observatory to measure the shifting carbon cycle of Lake Superior and other large lakes. Carbon cycling and bicycling are two of his passions.
